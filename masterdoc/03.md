### Exercise 1: Data ingestion from a spectrum of analytical and operational data sources into the Lakehouse.

As a data engineer at Wide World Importers, your initial task is to land data from various sources into the Lakehouse. This data will undergo further cleansing, processing, and validation using Azure Databricks and Delta Live Tables. This preparation step is crucial for downstream consumption by data scientists and business intelligence analysts. Data sources include customer data, product data, marketing campaign data, social media data, and sales transaction data, often stored in raw file formats like CSV, JSON, unstructured files, and images. Much of this data is historical.

To enhance customer satisfaction, gain a competitive edge, and drive revenue growth, Wide World Importers aims to analyze its data to extract meaningful insights regarding customers, marketing campaigns, and sales forecasts. However, the immediate challenge is to generate and utilize near real-time streaming data. To address this, IoT devices have been installed in stores to analyze customer shopping patterns and thermostat readings. Additionally, Azure Data Explorer (ADX) with anomaly detection capabilities has been set up to correlate in-store traffic with store temperatures. Consequently, there is now a significant volume of real-time streaming data available, including in-store traffic data, temperature readings, and anomaly detection data.

In this exercise, you will learn how to ingest near real-time data into the Lakehouse and extract valuable insights from it.

#### Task 1.1: Explore a Streaming data and analytics pipeline using ADX for a near real-time analytics scenario. <a name="streaming-data"></a>

In this task, you'll leverage Azure Data Explorer (ADX) to analyze thermostat data streamed in near real-time from stores to an Azure Event Hub. This data exploration aims to help Wide World Importers ensure optimal temperatures in stores and wine coolers, enhancing the in-store shopping experience for customers.

The scenario is set during the Black Friday Sale at 6:00 AM EST, where a significant influx of customers is expected at the Miami store. Thermostat data from the stores is continuously streamed to an Azure Event Hub and subsequently ingested into an ADX pool for real-time analysis.

Your objective is to use ADX to delve into this thermostat data, allowing Wide World Importers to monitor and manage temperatures effectively during this busy shopping event.

40.	Click on **Run**. 

41. In the **Results** pane at the bottom, examine the query result displayed as a chart. Please be patient as it may take up to 2-3 minutes to accumulate data. If you don't see any result, try re-running the query after some time.

    >**Note:** If you encounter no data in the query result, wait for a few minutes and try again as the data takes some time to start streaming. If your query returns an error, it's possible that the thermostat table wasn't created successfully in previous steps. You might need to create the table with a different name (e.g., Thermostat1), update the KQL query accordingly, and rerun the query.  

    ![Review the query result ](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Ignite-lab/blob/main/media/img_graph1.png?raw=true)

    *Your graph might differ slightly from the one shown above. It may take up to 60 seconds to load.*

42.	Notice that the temperature in the Miami store fluctuates between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. With these insights, we can adjust the temperatures to optimal levels.
